# Sign Language Detector

## Overview

Welcome to the Sign Language Detector project â€“ an innovative AI application designed to recognize and interpret sign language gestures from images. This project is equipped with a powerful deep learning model and a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) for seamless interaction.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Sign Language Detector, follow these steps:

1. Download the model weights file from the provided link: [Download Weights File](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshsaxenadn/sign-language-detectors).
2. Place the downloaded weights file in the project directory.

## Running the Sign Language Detector

### Option 1: GUI via Command Line

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Go to gui.py
4. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python sign_language_gui.py
   ```

### Option 2: Manual GUI Run

1. Open your preferred Python environment or IDE.
2. Open the `sign_language_gui.py` file.
3. Run the script.

## Note

Ensure that the weights file is downloaded and placed in the project directory before running the GUI.

Feel free to explore the Jupyter notebooks and other Python files in the repository for a deeper understanding of the sign language detection capabilities.

Happy signing! ðŸ¤ŸðŸš€
